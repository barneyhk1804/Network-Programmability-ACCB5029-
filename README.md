Within this repository contains two files Uniwork.Py And testwork.py

To run the code properly make sure. make sure you have first updated your virtual box depending on what you're using, but I would recommend using this in a virtual machine.

Then open your terminal and do the following

git clone https://github.com/barneyhk1804/Network-Programmability-ACCB5029-.git

cd Network-Programmability-ACCB5029-

Then choose either Uniwork.Py or testwork.py

lets say u want testwork.py

python3 testwork.py

Then it will prompt you to other city.



Uniwork.Py will show this when ran

Enter the city name: 

lets say we put in belfast

Enter the city name: belfast
Current weather in Belfast:
Temperature: 1.88°C
Description: scattered clouds
Humidity: 88%
Wind Speed: 1.54 m/

From here, it will show the basic things like temperature, description, humidity along with wind speed
just basic information about the weather in the current city you have chosen.


testwork.py

Same again for this one, but it has a little bit more information
It'll ask you to enter a city. I decided to put down Swansea.
Then it'll ask you if you would like it in Metric or imperial You can select either M or I. saved you writing up the entire thing for either one as showing below

enter the city name: swansea
Choose units (m for metric, i for imperial): m
I chose metric for this one.


Current weather in Swansea:
Temperature: 3.21°C
Description: light rain
Humidity: 79%
Wind Speed: 1.79 m/s
Pressure: 997 hPa
Visibility: 10000 meters

And here it is in Imperial

Enter the city name: swansea
Choose units (m for metric, i for imperial): i

Current weather in Swansea:
Temperature: 37.8°F
